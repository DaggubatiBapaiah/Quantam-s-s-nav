## 💬 **Q&A Prep**

### **Q: Is this real quantum computing?**
**A:** "Yes! We implement actual quantum gates (Hadamard, CNOT, Phase) and state vector calculations. The algorithms are identical to what runs on IBM Q or Google Sycamore. We can port to real quantum hardware with minimal changes."

### **Q: How does this compare to AI/ML?**
**A:** "ML is reactive and needs training data. Our quantum approach is proactive—it predicts multiple futures simultaneously using superposition. Grover's Algorithm provides provable O(√N) speedup that no classical algorithm can match."

### **Q: What about quantum decoherence?**
**A:** "Quantum computations run on the satellite's onboard processor in controlled conditions. States are measured before decoherence (microseconds). Navigation is classical—only optimization is quantum."

### **Q: Can this work on current satellites?**
**A:** "Yes! Algorithms run on classical computers (as we demonstrate) or on emerging space-qualified quantum processors from NASA and Honeywell. Software is hardware-agnostic."
