# ✅ Satellites Moved Further from Earth!

## Changes Made

I've adjusted the satellite visualization to make them more visible and clearly separated from Earth:

### 🎯 **Visual Scale Multiplier: 50x**

Satellites are now displayed **50 times further** from Earth than their actual orbital distances. This is necessary because:

- Real satellites orbit very close to Earth (408 km - 35,786 km)
- At solar system scale, they would be invisible
- The multiplier makes them clearly visible while maintaining orbital patterns

### 📏 **Size Increases**

All satellites have been made larger for better visibility:

| Satellite | Old Size | New Size | Increase |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| ISS | 3 | 5 | +67% |
| Hubble | 2.5 | 4 | +60% |
| GPS (all) | 2 | 3.5 | +75% |
| Starlink (all) | 1.5 | 3 | +100% |
| GOES-16 | 2 | 3.5 | +75% |

### 🌟 **Visual Result**

Now you'll see:
- ✅ Satellites clearly orbiting **around** Earth, not on top of it
- ✅ Distinct orbital paths visible
- ✅ GPS constellation pattern clearly visible
- ✅ Better separation between different satellite types
- ✅ Easier to click and identify individual satellites

**Note:** The orbital mechanics are still accurate - only the visual scale has been adjusted for better viewing at solar system scale! 🛰️✨
